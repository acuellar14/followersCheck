#Instagram Followers Check
- This project uses Selenium to log into your Instagram account and find out who is not following you back and who you are not following back.
- While Selenium is not the most efficient way to solve this problem, it gave me a real life problem to solve while being able to practice python and Selenium (browser automation).

**Troubleshooting**
- Remember to hardcode in your username and password
- You may need to download and replace the latest chromedriver.exe to match the version of Chrome on your machine (some code changes will be needed if you want to use another web browser).

**Future enhancements**
- Prompt for username and password to prevent hardcoding sensitive information.
- Auto download appropriate chromedriver.exe version.
